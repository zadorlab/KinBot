## Description
This repository contains the KinBot code version 2.0,
a tool for automatically searching for reactions on the potential energy surface.

If you are using this tool in scientific publications, please reference this git repo and the following publication:

Ruben Van de Vijver, Judit Zádor: KinBot: Automated stationary point search on potential energy surfaces, Computer Physics Communication, 2019, 106947 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.106947

## How to Install
Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed. The dependencies are lister here https://github.com/zadorlab/KinBot/wiki/Setting-Up-KinBot-on-Your-System 

Clone the project to the place where you want to run it. Make sure you switch to the latest version, e.g., 2.0.5:

    git branch 2.0.5

You can find the latest stable version's tag if you click on the Branch button above on this page.

In your local space go into the KinBot/ directory. Run the following:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
    
If you do not have admin priveleges, you might have to run

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install --user
    
Moreover, if you plan to modify the code, you need to install it as:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py develop --user

## How to Run
To run KinBot (which will only explore one well), make an input file (e.g. input.json) and run:

    kinbot input.json

To run a full PES search, make an input file (e.g. input.json) and run:

    pes input.json

You can find additional command line arguments in the manual.
